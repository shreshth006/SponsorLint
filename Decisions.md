# Decisions — SponsorLint

Why the project is shaped the way it is. Read this before proposing a change to `PRD.md`, `Architecture.md`, or `Rules.md` — most "obvious improvements" were already considered and rejected for a reason recorded here.

Format: **the decision · the alternative · why · what would change our minds.**

---

## D1 · Build SponsorLint, not Cutcheck

**Decided:** Aug 15, 2026, after an adversarial bakeoff (two advocates + a judge). Full record in git history: `git show e759a5b:docs/BAKEOFF.md`.

**Alternative:** Cutcheck — mine a creator's own retention curves for editing patterns that coincide with viewer drop-off, then lint the next unpublished cut.

**Why SponsorLint won, 7.6 to 6.7 on the rubric:**

Cutcheck is the **better idea**, and it lost anyway. Under a 72-hour clock with retention exports already on disk, it would be the pick. That was not the situation.

| | Cutcheck | SponsorLint |
|---|---|---|
| Functionality 30% | 6 | **8** |
| Usefulness 30% | 7 | **8** |
| Creativity 20% | **8** | 7 |
| Technical execution 20% | 6 | **7** |

The three findings that decided it:

1. **Cutcheck's Phase 0 was a four-way conjunction on a stranger's weekend.** A creator must agree within hours, perform 5–10 per-video Studio exports, *also* hand over multi-gigabyte source files, and have a channel large enough that the curves are not noise. Probability of clean data by hour 8: under 20%.
2. **Total function vs. partial function.** A brief always compiles to rules; rules always evaluate to a status; the report is never empty. Cutcheck can legitimately produce *nothing* — if no rule clears minimum support, the product ceases to exist, and you discover that around hour 14–20 with one recovery available: fake the data.
3. **Cutcheck is cliff-edged, not layered.** Its Phases 1–3 produce no user-facing output. A Cutcheck that halts at Phase 2 is a script that detects silence in an MP4. SponsorLint at hour 8 is a working script, and the event says explicitly that a working script counts.

**What would change our minds:** nothing, within this hackathon. See D2.

---

## D2 · If retention data arrives mid-build, do not switch

**Why:** Cutcheck from a cold start in the remaining hours, with data landing mid-build and no validation harness, is a worse bet than a finished SponsorLint. Switching abandons certain progress for a project with four more gates ahead of it.

Bank the data. Cutcheck is a genuinely good post-hackathon project and will still be good in September, built properly, with a backtest and the promise–payoff analysis a 36-hour version would have to cut.

---

## D3 · The LLM compiles; deterministic code verifies

**Alternative:** feed the brief and the transcript to an LLM and ask "is this compliant?"

**Why:** four properties fall out of the split, and none survive the alternative.

| Property | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Reproducible | Same inputs → same output. A judge who reruns gets the same answer |
| Auditable | Every FAIL cites a transcript line and a source quote |
| **Testable** | The eval harness (D5) is only possible because verdicts are deterministic |
| Debuggable | Each stage is a separate CLI command |

It is also the answer to the objection every AI submission faces: *"isn't this just a wrapper?"* — **the LLM never sees the transcript.**

**What would change our minds:** a rule type that genuinely cannot be verified deterministically. Those go to `MANUAL REVIEW` instead (D6).

---

## D4 · The user approves the spec before verification runs

**Alternative:** compile the brief and go straight to checking.

**Why:** one screen kills three objections at once.

| Objection | Killed by |
|---|---|
| "The LLM hallucinated the requirements" | Every rule cites its source sentence |
| "You planted the errors you found" | The judge adds their own rule and re-runs |
| "Can you trust an LLM to read a contract?" | You don't have to — the correction **is** the product |

Trust model: **the model proposes the specification, the user owns the specification, deterministic code enforces the approved specification.**

Every other AI submission at this event is an oracle. Ours has a spec the user can argue with.

**This is why `Phases.md` GATE 12:00 is "changing 73% to 70% flips the verdict"** — if the edit does not change the outcome, the screen is a mockup and the whole argument collapses.

---

## D5 · The eval harness is required, not a stretch goal

**Borrowed from the losing side.** Cutcheck's earlier plan had a `backtest` verb producing a real precision number; its own execution bible then deleted it — removing the single best answer to its worst objection. We took the idea.

**Why:** almost no hackathon submission measures its own claims. A disclaimer is a pre-emptive concession; a measured number is a defense. It also directly answers *"isn't this just string matching?"* — it's string matching **that we measured**, which is more than the rest of the field can say.

**Tuning policy — the reasoning behind it:**

> A false FAIL wastes the creator's afternoon. A false PASS ships a broken sponsor read to the brand. The two errors are not symmetric, so we avoid false FAILs, route ambiguity to `MANUAL REVIEW`, and then maximize violation catch rate.

That is a designed engineering tradeoff, stated in one sentence, backed by a number.

**Publish the real number even if it is bad.** A mediocre measured number outscores an unmeasured claim with anyone who has a research background.

---

## D6 · Unverifiable requirements become MANUAL REVIEW

**Alternatives rejected:** silently drop them · let the LLM guess · build OCR.

**Why:** a tool that refuses to fake a verdict is demonstrating judgment, and judgment is what Technical execution measures. It also converts our largest capability gap into a trust feature.

**On OCR specifically:** `easyocr` pulls ~2GB of torch on Windows and tesseract needs a system binary. It is a stretch goal that eats hour 20 and returns nothing. `MANUAL REVIEW` is not the consolation prize here — it is the better answer.

---

## D7 · Disclosure placement is an advisory, not a verdict

**Earlier draft got this wrong** and emitted *"unlikely to be considered clear and conspicuous"* — FTC statutory language, which contradicted our own rule against legal claims.

**Current behavior:** if the brief specifies placement (the demo brief says *"near the beginning"*), enforce it as a normal rule. If it does not and disclosure is late, emit an advisory only. **Never quote regulatory language. Never call it non-compliance.**

We check the supplied brief, not the law.

---

## D8 · The demo brief is prose, and every sentence is deliberate

**Alternative:** a clean bulleted requirements list.

**Why:** if the brief is already structured, the compiler looks like it parsed a list, and the whole D3 architecture argument collapses into *"I asked an LLM to read a formatted document."* No regex extracts `min_seconds: 60` from *"no shorter than one minute."*

**Two specific choices that look like mistakes and are not:**

- **`seventy-three percent` spelled out, buried mid-sentence.** Writing `73%` as digits hands the compiler an easy extraction and removes the numeral-normalization moment, which is the ten seconds that prove the pipeline is real.
- **Prohibited claims quoted literally** (`"completely anonymous"`, `"unhackable"`) rather than paraphrased. An earlier draft wrote *"characterize the service as making the user untraceable"* — more realistic, but it creates a semantic gap a deterministic `MUST_NOT_SAY` cannot bridge, silently breaking the demo. Realism loses to a working chain.

Do not "improve" the brief in `PRD.md` §5.

---

## D9 · Fictional brand throughout

Earlier drafts used `Threat Protection Pro` and `nordvpn.com/alex` — a real company's actual product name and URL format, inside a fabricated brief with fabricated compliance violations, in a public repo.

Needless risk and it reads as careless. `Aegis VPN` / `aegisvpn.com/alex` / `Shield Mode` cost ten minutes and remove an unforced error.

---

## D10 · Zero-key demo path is a core deliverable

**Assume the judge is never in the room.** The event is repo + README + optional video. Someone clones at 2 AM and gives us sixty seconds.

Two walls kill that, and both sit on the default path unless explicitly removed:

- an `OPENAI_API_KEY` prompt → gone in thirty seconds
- a Whisper model download → gone in sixty

`python -m sponsorlint demo` runs the **real verifier** against committed fixtures. Split requirements files enforce it.

> **Caching is not cheating; fake output is.** The check executes for real; only the expensive, deterministic upstream steps are cached.

This also neutralizes the one genuine structural advantage Cutcheck had — being zero-key by construction — for about 30 minutes of work.

---

## D11 · The README is the primary judging surface

The demo video is **optional**. That means most of the field will pour their last hours into a video and ship three lines of markdown. The README is therefore the cheapest differentiation available at this event.

Consequence in `Phases.md`: the README gets a dedicated 2.5-hour block, and the eval number goes **above** the feature list because most repos bury validation.

---

## D12 · Zero-key demo lands at Phase 4, not Phase 8

**Alternative:** build it near the end, alongside polish.

**Why:** it is the safety net, so it should arrive early. At `T+7:00` the project is submittable — real analysis, measured, runnable by a stranger. Everything after raises the ceiling; nothing after is load-bearing. A safety net delivered last is not a safety net.

---

## D13 · Six rule types, hard limit

**Why:** each additional type is a new normalization surface, new fixtures, new failure modes, and a new way for the demo to break. The six cover the demo brief completely and every common sponsor requirement that is verifiable from audio or duration.

**What would change our minds:** all twenty acceptance tests passing with time left.

---

## D14 · Vanilla stack, no build step

FastAPI + Jinja2 + vanilla JS + plain CSS. No Next.js, no React unless it is already faster for the team, no bundler.

**Why:** a build step is a category of failure that produces nothing a judge can see. The UI is three screens and a list of cards. `Design.md` specifies it fully in CSS custom properties.

**Fallback if the UI fights us for more than an hour:** ship the CLI. The event says a working script counts, and `Rules.md` §9 puts the web UI last in the cut order.

---

## D15 · `faster-whisper` `base.en` on CPU, no GPU path

**Why:** the single most likely hour-sink in the build, and it buys nothing on a 75-second clip. No CUDA detection, no GPU wheels, no second code path.

---

## D16 · Transcribe once, cache forever

Whisper runs **once** during development, at Phase 1. `samples/transcript.v1.json` is then the fixture for the remaining thirty hours.

**Why:** it makes every downstream iteration instant, it makes the validators testable without media, and it is what the zero-key demo ships against.

**Corollary — the Phase 0 reality check:** transcribe the three planted error sentences *before* committing to the script. If Whisper garbles "seventy percent," change the script to a mistake it can hear. The entire demo centerpiece rests on one transcription, and finding out at hour 26 is fatal.

---

## D17 · Six hours of sleep are in the plan

**Why:** the builder is one person on a ~30-hour clock. Every gate after `T+13:30` is judgment work rather than typing. A plan with no sleep block is a plan that gets abandoned around hour 20, and the last four hours are worth nothing if you cannot think.

---

## D18 · The goal is un-dismissable, not unbeatable

A project that "cannot lose against anyone" is not achievable. Judging is stochastic, 20% of the rubric is explicitly taste, and we control neither the field nor demo order nor judge fatigue.

The achievable target: **no judge can complete the sentence *"this doesn't work"* or *"I've seen this one."*** Un-dismissable projects do not always win, but they never place badly — and in a field where most submissions are dismissible in ten seconds, that is most of the distance.

Every one of D5, D10, D11, and D12 exists to serve that target.

---

## D19 · Four freeze corrections, and the plan is now closed

Applied Aug 15, 2026, from a final review pass. Three of the four were already absent from the seven documents and are now stated **explicitly** rather than merely not violated — absence is not a guardrail, since a future agent reintroduces what nobody forbade.

**19a · Validator taxonomy.** Earlier drafts drifted between "six rule types" and "eight validators." Fixed form (`PRD.md` §4.1):

```
6 executable rule types
+ 1 disclosure-placement advisory   (a property of the MUST_DISCLOSE result)
+ 1 MANUAL_REVIEW outcome           (what happens when no validator exists)
```

`MANUAL_REVIEW` is not a validator — it is the absence of one. Counting it as a rule type inflates the surface and muddies the architecture.

**19b · No invented disclosure threshold.** An earlier draft flagged disclosure occurring after 25% of the segment or 30 seconds, with the string *"unlikely to be considered clear and conspicuous."* Both are removed. That threshold was **a rule not derived from the sponsor brief** — we would have been inventing a requirement on the creator's behalf — and the wording was FTC statutory language, contradicting D7 and `Rules.md` §8. Current behavior in `Architecture.md` §5.4: brief specifies placement → enforce; otherwise → show the timestamp, optional advisory, never a verdict.

**19c · "False positive" is banned as a term.** It reverses meaning depending on whether the reader treats a violation or a passing check as the positive event — so a judge can read our strongest engineering stance backwards. Replaced everywhere with `False FAIL` and `False PASS`, defined once in `Architecture.md` §7 with the asymmetric cost attached to each.

**19d · Do not engineer weights to hit a score.** The `57% → 86%` figures in earlier drafts were illustrative and risked becoming a target. Demo material now uses the raw fraction (`4/7 → 6/7 → 7/7`), which is more trustworthy and cannot be accused of tuning. `Rules.md` §1.15 makes it a rule.

**And the plan is frozen.** `Rules.md` §0 now closes it. The product was chosen through adversarial review, the corrections are applied, and further review rounds produce plausible new features at the cost of hours we do not have. The only permitted review prompt from here:

> *"Find contradictions, implementation blockers, or requirements that cannot be completed within the deadline. Do not propose new features."*

---

## D21 · Hardening pass — nine implementation blockers closed

Aug 16, 2026. A six-lens survey of the frozen documents, scoped strictly to `Rules.md` §0 (contradictions, blockers, deadline risks — no new features). It found nine distinct defects, several verified empirically rather than argued. **No scope changed; every fix makes already-decided behavior implementable.**

**21a · `rapidfuzz.ratio` was the wrong scorer — measured, not debated.** `fuzz.ratio` is whole-string similarity. Against the project's own §7 fixtures it scores every true match 10–67, so **at threshold ≥90 nothing could ever pass** — implementing the spec literally would have returned FAIL for every phrase rule in the demo, discovered at GATE 3:10. `partial_token_set_ratio` is worse: it returns **100.0** on both documented hard negatives ("shield feature", "little league"), a false-PASS generator. Fix: `fuzz.partial_ratio`, with the measured table in `Architecture.md` §5.2 so nobody re-litigates it. Worst true-negative margin is 83.3, leaving 6.7 points of headroom — hence the standing rule not to move the threshold in either direction.

**21b · Phrase matching had no defined haystack.** Measured: a phrase split across a Whisper segment break scores **70.6** per-segment vs **100.0** joined. The obvious `for seg in segments` loop produces false FAILs that depend on where Whisper happens to cut — so it can pass at GATE 3:10 and fail after the Phase 9 re-splice at T+23:30. Fix: always match the joined transcript, keep an offset→segment map for timestamps.

**21c · The Rule schema could not express half the rule types.** One scalar `expected` cannot hold a duration window, a two-phrase prohibition, or a placement constraint — yet `Design.md` rendered `min_seconds`/`max_seconds` and GATE 10:00 literally names `min_seconds`. Agent A and Agent B would have invented incompatible shapes eight hours apart, and correcting the model later would have broken the already-committed zero-key fixture. Fix: the pinned Pydantic model plus a per-type payload table in `Architecture.md` §4.1.

**21d · The disclosure-placement paradox.** D19b forbids inventing a threshold; `Architecture.md` §5.4 required enforcing *"near the beginning"*, which has no number. Mandated and prohibited at once. Fix: route the number through the trust boundary — the compiler emits `within_first_seconds: null, needs_review: true`, the spec is **not approvable** until the user supplies a value, and the committed demo spec ships a user-authored `15`. D4 doing exactly what it exists for.

**21e · DURATION had three competing sources and no way in.** `ffprobe` (which `Rules.md` §5 forbids a pure validator from calling), `transcript.duration_seconds`, and a `video-metadata.v1.json` whose schema was defined nowhere — while `verify --spec --transcript` had no third argument to pass it. Fix: `transcript.duration_seconds` is the sole source, `ffprobe` runs upstream at transcribe time, `video-metadata.v1.json` deleted. This also means **the demo needs no ffmpeg on the judge's machine**.

**21f · The zero-key demo would have crashed on a transitive import.** Verified by building the exact folder layout: a module-scope `from .transcript.transcribe import ...` in `cli.py` makes `python -m sponsorlint demo` die with `ModuleNotFoundError` in a demo-only venv, **before dispatch runs**. It would never appear locally — the dev machine has faster-whisper — and would surface at T+27:30, after the README and GIF were recorded. This is the single deliverable D10/D12 call the safety net. Fix: import discipline rule plus an AST check in Phase 4, and a mandatory verification in a `requirements-demo.txt`-only venv.

**21g · Two invocation forms.** `sponsorlint demo` appeared in the acceptance criteria and the README GIF spec; `python -m sponsorlint demo` everywhere else. Verified: no `pyproject.toml`, no `setup.py`, no console script exists anywhere in the plan, so the bare form cannot work — a judge copy-pasting the quickstart gets `'sponsorlint' is not recognized`, on the 60-second first impression. Fix: `python -m sponsorlint` everywhere, and an explicit "no packaging, run from repo root" note.

**21h · The V1 verdict was wrong in four files.** `Design.md` §7 printed three FAIL cards and then summed them as "2 failed · 1 warning", and that phantom WARN was pinned in `Memory.md` — the file every fresh agent reads first. The "warning" was a disclosure check whose own body said **OK**. An agent reconciling the numbers would have downgraded a real FAIL to `severity: warning` to make the sum work, which is a hardcoded verdict (`Rules.md` §1.11). Fix: `3 FAIL · 0 WARN · 4 PASS · 1 MANUAL → 4/7 → DO NOT SEND`, everywhere. All seven demo rules are `severity: error`.

**21i · V3 could never reach SPONSOR READY.** `Architecture.md` §5.5's ladder sent manual-review items to `REVIEW`; the next line said they never block `SPONSOR READY`. The demo brief *always* carries one manual-review item, so the readiness ladder as written made the payoff frame of the README GIF unreachable — and both readings were defensible, so review would not have caught it. Fix: three mutually exclusive clauses in which manual-review items appear nowhere.

**Also closed:** the spoken-numeral algorithm (`word2number` tested and rejected — it raises on `"save 73 percent"` and folds `"two zero"` to 2; replaced with a run-scanner plus a membership test), the LLM provider (decided, with a pre-flight smoke call at minute ten instead of hour eight), `faster-whisper` never being installed by any phase despite being needed at T+0:15, and Phase 0's 45-minute budget for ~95 minutes of work.

**One gate was strengthened, not just fixed.** GATE 2:00 previously tested only the strings that must be *caught*. It now also tests the strings that must be *recognized* — `"Shield Mode"`, `aegisvpn.com/alex`, `"seventy-three percent"`, `HARSH20`. V3 reaching 7/7 depends entirely on those, and `aegisvpn.com/alex` is a fabricated name `base.en` may mangle. Discovering that at Phase 9 means the arc can never close.

**Correction, Session 4:** `HARSH20` is exercised by the promo-code normalization
acceptance test, but it is not present in the frozen demo brief, canonical seven-rule
spec, or recording script. GATE 2:00 therefore has six spoken strings, not seven;
requiring a seventh would force the recording to invent a requirement the brief never made.

## D22 · Trust holes closed after adversarial audit

Aug 16, 2026. This decision supersedes D21i's treatment of manual-review readiness. An unchecked
visual requirement cannot coexist honestly with `SPONSOR READY`. Manual items now carry an explicit
`confirmed` boolean: unresolved items produce `REVIEW`, confirmed items remain outside the automated
score, and only a fully resolved spec can become `SPONSOR READY`.

The same audit established five related constraints: fuzzy `MUST_SAY` matches must respect whole
tokens and only repair adjacent-letter transpositions; negated disclosures do not count;
`URL_OR_CTA.within_last_seconds` makes a closing CTA a real placement check; compiler-provided source
quotes must literally occur in the submitted brief after whitespace normalization; and the one-shot
`analyze --yes` path is removed because it bypassed human approval. These are hardening changes to
the existing trust architecture, not new product scope.

## D23 · Gemini is the canonical hackathon compiler

Aug 17, 2026. Anthropic billing was unavailable, so the single compiler provider changed to the
official `google-genai` SDK with `gemini-3-flash-preview`, which Google documents as structured-output
capable and available on the Gemini API free tier. This is a replacement, not a multi-provider
abstraction: no registry, router, fallback chain, tools, search, or transcript access was added.

The live `samples/brief.pdf` call returned seven rules and one manual item. The response passed the
authoritative `Spec` model and literal quote grounding, then received explicit human approval with
15-second opening and closing placement thresholds. The model proposes only; approval and the
deterministic verifier remain unchanged.

---

## D24 · Three normalization corrections, and the guess the normalizer will not make

Aug 20, 2026. Three defects in `normalize/`, all of the same family: the stage reported a value the
transcript did not contain.

**Decided — a number-word run is bounded twice, not maximal.**

A run was every adjacent number-word, summed. `"nineteen ninety nine"` became `118`,
`"twenty twenty four"` became `44`, `"three thirty"` became `33`. Separately, a run walked across a
full stop, so `"chapter two. three things"` folded to `"chapter 5 things"`. A word that cannot
continue the current number now closes it, and so does a sentence boundary.

**The alternative we rejected — inferring the number a human would hear.** `"nineteen ninety nine"`
is a year or a price, and 1999 or 19.99 is very often what was meant. Producing `19 99` looks like a
half-measure next to that.

**Why:** because the two failures are not the same size. Splitting a run reports two numbers that
were both genuinely spoken, and a brief requiring neither simply does not match. Inferring 1999
invents a four-digit value from three words on a convention the speaker never stated — and if that
inference is wrong, EXACT_VALUE returns PASS against a number nobody said. That is a False PASS, and
§7 is explicit that the two error types are not symmetric. **The normalizer reports; the compiler
is the only component allowed to interpret**, and only once, at approval time, in front of a human.

**Decided — `point` opens a per-digit run.** `"nine point nine nine"` is 9.99. Folding the tail
arithmetically would give 9 and 18, which is the same fabrication in a different costume. Trailing
zeros are kept literally so `9.90` still matches a brief that wrote the price that way.

**Decided — the identifier gate admits separators.** `SAVE-20` failed `looks_like_code`, and a value
that gate rejects is handed to the prose path and fuzzy-matched. Fuzzy-matching a tracked code is
what §5.2 exists to forbid; the measured margin between a campaign's code and somebody else's is a
few points. `spoken_pattern` already stripped separators, so only the gate was shut.

**What would change our minds on the first one:** a labeled corpus of real sponsor reads showing
that spoken years and prices appear in briefs often enough that splitting them costs more matches
than inference would cost in False PASSes. That is a measurement, not an argument — and it would go
in the eval fixtures before it went in the normalizer.

---

## D25 · Autopilot is a workflow controller, not a second verifier

Aug 30, 2026. The retake loop added for the hackathon. The whole design question was where to put
the agent so that adding it cannot weaken anything already here.

**Decided — Autopilot gets four powers and no fifth.** Inspect a `Report`, write a checklist, call
`lint.engine.run`, decide continue / escalate / stop. It has no route to a verdict: readiness
arrives from the existing resolver already decided and is copied. A test walks the AST of every
module in the package and fails on any *assignment* containing `SPONSOR_READY`; comparisons are
fine, authorship is not.

**The alternative we rejected — letting the agent adjust the spec toward what was recorded.** It is
the obvious "helpful" behaviour and it is the one thing that would destroy the product. A tool whose
expected values drift toward the take is not a verifier, it is a rubber stamp with extra steps. The
planner therefore *restates* `rule.expected` and nothing else, and the run holds a deep copy of the
spec plus a SHA-256 fingerprint of everything it is not allowed to change.

**Decided — the fingerprint excludes `ManualReviewItem.confirmed`.** A human confirming a visual
item is the one sanctioned mid-run change to a spec. Including the flag would have made the
sanctioned path indistinguishable from tampering, and the fix for that would have been an exception
in the tamper check — which is how tamper checks die. Excluding one field that only a human can set
is narrower than excusing one code path.

**Decided — three iterations, then a person.** Not "until it passes". An agent that keeps asking for
retakes is the failure mode that makes people turn agents off; `ESCALATED` is a real outcome and a
non-zero CLI exit, not an error state.

**Decided — `WAITING_FOR_RETAKE` is a genuine stop, with no timer behind it.** There is no `step()`,
no tick, no background task. The only way out is a call carrying a transcript a person supplied.
This is what keeps "the agent produced a corrected take" from ever being true: Autopilot cannot
write media, and editing a transcript and calling it a recording is the specific lie the state
machine is shaped to make impossible.

**Decided — `_transition` is the only writer of trace events.** Every visible line is appended at
the moment the transition executes. A test asserts `run.trace.append` appears exactly once in the
module. A trace assembled anywhere else is a story about work rather than a record of it, and the
cheapest way to keep that honest is to leave only one door.

**What would change our minds on the iteration bound:** evidence from real campaigns that a fourth
cycle closes findings often enough to be worth the loop. That is a measurement; until then, three.

## Open questions

| Question | Owner | Resolve by |
|---|---|---|
| ~~Which LLM provider for the compiler~~ | — | **Superseded by D23** — `google-genai` / `gemini-3-flash-preview`, live-tested and human-approved |
| Whether the eval fixture count lands at 24 or 30 | — | Phase 3 |
| Whether jump-to-timestamp survives the cut | — | Phase 8 |

---

## Superseded documents

Deleted from the working tree; **retained in git history** (`git show e759a5b:docs/<file>`). They are history, not instructions.

| File | What it was | Contradicts |
|---|---|---|
| `STRATEGY.md` | Original Cutcheck pitch and rubric decode | D1 — wrong product |
| `BAKEOFF.md` | The full adversarial comparison and rulings — source for D1 | — |
| `SponsorLint_Project_Bible.md` | First SponsorLint plan | **D9** — uses a real brand's product name and URL |
| `SPONSORLINT_EXECUTION_BIBLE.superseded.md` | Second plan, folding in the bakeoff | **D7, D19b** — emits FTC statutory language |
| `SPONSORLINT_FINAL_EXECUTION_BIBLE.md` | Third plan | D19a — validator-count drift |

**Why they were removed rather than archived in-repo:** each is a superseded authority, and two contain instructions these documents explicitly reverse. An agent that greps the repo, or a session pointed at a folder, reintroduces a documented bug. Git already preserves everything, so an archive folder alongside version control is redundant *and* a loaded gun.

## D20 · Keep the bible, as a reference narrative

**Kept:** `docs/SPONSORLINT_BIBLE.md` — the merged bible, direct source of the seven documents.

**Why keep it** when D19's whole argument was that superseded authorities are dangerous: a single readable file has real uses the seven do not cover — onboarding a person, pasting into a tool that wants one document, drafting the submission blurb. The seven are optimized for an agent working one phase at a time; the bible is optimized for a human reading end to end.

**Why it is safe, unlike the four that were deleted:**

1. Its header was inverted — it now declares itself a reference narrative and states that root documents win any disagreement.
2. It carries all four D19 corrections. It does not contradict anything.
3. It is one file with an unambiguous status line, not a folder of four rival plans.

**The standing obligation:** anyone editing a root document either updates the bible to match or flips its header to `STALE`. **A reference narrative that has silently drifted is worse than none** — it is precisely the failure mode D19 was about, wearing a friendlier label.
